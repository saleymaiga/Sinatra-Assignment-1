Sinatra-Assignment-1
====================

  Take your personal website project and convert it into a Ruby/Sinatra-based website.

  Start with the basics: declare the correct routes in your main app file.

  Then move over the views into the /views folder.

  Donâ€™t worry about images or CSS for now, just get the HTML to show up.
